# About me ‚≠ê

Hey my handle is IXRMTT, I'm a freelance Full Stack Developer from the United Kingdom.
Im 17 years old and I also 3d Model in my spare time, I've been interested in code for a long time (roughly 6 years) and started learning about 4 years ago.
I've made projects like a DS and GameBoy Emulator using C++, online shop websites (HTML, SASS, CSS, SQL, JSON, JS) and other python projects, such as a network mapper, custom encryption etc.
I'm mainly a HTML, SASS, CSS, JSON, SQL (I hate back end). I use frameworks such as figma, tailwind, angular, express, DJango, MongoDB and Bootstrap.
I use VS Code, and enjoy making projects, I'm currently making my own webchat service called IXR.

These are the codes I can use:
